Set custom respawn points for your survial world or pvp-server!
RespawnPoints is a mod in Minecraft that has introduced a new idea of arranging and handling the respawn points. It provides players and server administrators the opportunity to form and control groups of respawn points. Useful for PvP battles, minigames and all cases where you need more flexibility in respawn point management.

**FEATURES**

- **Create and manage respawn points:** Easily add new respawn points to specific groups using commands.
- **Multiple group support:** Create different groups of respawn points and switch between them.
- **Automatic data saving:** All groups and respawn points are automatically saved even after a game or server restart.
- **Compatible with multiplayer servers:** The mod works correctly both in single-player and on Minecraft servers.
- **Randomized respawn point selection:** After death, players will be revived at a random point from the active group, making gameplay more dynamic and unpredictable.

Download the mod and place it in the mods folder of your Minecraft installation with Fabric.
